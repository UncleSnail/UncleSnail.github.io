              <li><span class="highlight">Which of your signature themes describe you best?</span> I would say that achiever describes me best. I am always seeking to do my best. I try to work as hard as possible, and all though I can handle failure, I pursue success until I have achieved what I consider to be the highest level of which I am capable. Unfortunately, it is getting harder, particularly this year, as I now understand what people mean when they say “senioritis”. For the past few years I have been trying to strike a good balance between doing my best and not taking too much unnecessary time to complete tasks.</li>
              <li><span class="highlight">Which of your signature themes do you use most frequently?</span> Learner. I am always learning, and seeking to learn even more. That is why I am taking dual credit courses, and it is why most of my “leisure time” also involves some sort of learning new things. I don’t necessarily enjoy the process of learning, but I like gaining new knowledge, and being able to do new things, so I learn. I try to focus my learning on useful things that are actually on a path to achieving my goals, but I also learn random things and facts. I can’t tell you how many Today I Found Out videos I’ve watched on YouTube.</li>
              <li><span class="highlight">Which of your signature themes do you anticipate using most in college or in your career?</span> I anticipate using ideation the most. I plan to be a computer programmer, and that involves a lot of thinking. In fact, I consider myself a “problem solver”. I enjoy programming, but the part I enjoy about it is the problem solving and ideas behind it. Thinking up answers to interesting logic puzzles, or finding a good way to implement something I would like to create. Those are the things I enjoy. I like coming up with ideas, then finding ways to implement them. This is also very useful during college. Ideation is basically the ability and love for understanding and generating ideas. This means it is very useful in college as well. It is also why I like inventing new things, like programs, stories, characters, or inventions. They all have to do with ideas.</li>
              <li><span class="highlight">Which signature theme surprises you the most?</span> I was not really surprised by any of the themes, but I think I was most surprised by the “belief” theme. All of my other themes could be easily determined by the survey, but I’m not entirely sure why that one showed up. I am a strong believer, and believe in a lot of things, so it makes sense, but all the others make sense too. There is no way I am surprised by ideation, strategic, or achiever. That just leaves learner and belief. Since I seek learning all the time, I can’t say I am surprised by it. This leaves me with just belief to put here, all though I am not surprised by it at all. I don’t think it would take too long for someone who comes into contact with me to realize that I have firm beliefs about things.</li>

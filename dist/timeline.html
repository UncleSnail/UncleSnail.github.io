            Senior year, I was the development manager and squad lead on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq_fsWA1mQ4&t=27s" target="_blank">team's project</a> for <a href="https://connectionshomes.org/" target="_blank">Connections Homes</a>. We used a C# back-end with a React front-end to create a matching tool that helps relationship managers match youth with seeking families. This was deployed to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/" target="_blank">AWS Amplify</a> using a serverless application model.<br/>
            After the <a href="https://computing.unl.edu/senior-design/showcase-projects-2021-22/" target="_blank">Senior Design</a> project, I continued as a maintainer and developer helping to improve the feature set and ensure the smooth running of the application. Watch our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq_fsWA1mQ4&t=27s" target="_blank">showcase presentation</a> for a look at the application. I received an <a href="https://computing.unl.edu/senior-design/archives-2021-2022/#YIR" target="_blank">individual rockstar award</a> for my work on this project.

            My second internship was with Myelin Solutions writing in React.js and Ruby on Rails. During the internship, my main projects were parsing XML documents, full system testing of new and existing features, setting up multithreaded Ruby workers with <a href="https://sidekiq.org/" target="_blank">Sidekiq</a>, and creating an algorithm to help physicians prioritize their tasks for the day.<br/>
            One project involved precomputing urgency matching scores between patients and physicians allowing for minimal calculation to find an optimal fit at run time. Another involved setting up an asynchronous threaded task runner to retrieve and parse documents more quickly in the background. In both of these projects, my solutions increased time performance by several orders of magnitude.

          <div class="content">
            Junior year, my "Senior Design" project was WetSpace, where I was the lead front-end developer. WetSpace is a tool for researchers in biological systems and nanotechnology that helps them more easily run simulations in two existing projects, WetCode and PaRedox. Researchers can create pipelines so that the results of one simulation are given as input to the next, and easily track results over multiple runs.<br/>
            We used Java for the back-end and React.js for the front-end. Working on WetSpace reinforced the skills needed to interface with existing software and read code written by other teams.

            My first internship was at <a href="https://www.noblhealth.com/" target="_blank">Nobl Health</a> writing in JavaScript and PHP. During the internship, my first project was adding customization features to existing performance metric graphs, such as other graph types, best-fit lines, and moving average curves. Second, I added a new "patient management" page to the admin tool so that customers could manually update patient information. Third, I updated CSV export features and allowed exporting in marked-up XLSX. Finally, I created an option to download pages from the application as PDFs.

            My first real open-source contribution was to <a href="https://www.pitivi.org/" target="_blank">Pitivi</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank">FOSS</a> video editor written in Python. On a team with two other students, we resolved an <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pitivi/-/issues/2029" target="_blank">issue</a> to restore the editor state for each project when it was closed and reopened. In contact with Alexandru, one of the main devs, I helped on this issue until the final <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pitivi/-/merge_requests/289" target="_blank">merge request</a> was accepted.

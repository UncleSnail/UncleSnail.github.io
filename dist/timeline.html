When the player earns a high enough score, more levels are unlocked with more new keys and faster speeds of existing keys.

            My second internship was with Myelin Solutions writing in <b>React.js</b> and <b>Ruby on Rails</b>.

            One project involved precomputing urgency matching scores between patients and physicians allowing for minimal calculation to find an optimal fit at run time. Another involved setting up an asynchronous threaded task runner to retrieve and parse documents more quickly in the background. In both of these projects, my solutions increased time performance by several orders of magnitude.

            Junior year, my "Senior Design" project was WetSpace, where I was the <b>lead front-end developer</b>. WetSpace is a tool for researchers in biological systems and nanotechnology that helps them more easily run simulations in two existing projects, WetCode and PaRedox. Researchers can create pipelines so that the results of one simulation are given as input to the next, and easily track results over multiple runs.<br/>
            We used <b>Java</b> for the back-end and <b>React.js</b> for the front-end. Working on WetSpace reinforced the skills needed to interface with existing software and read code written by other teams.

Second, I added a new "patient management" page to the admin tool so that customers could manually update patient information. Third, I updated CSV export features and allowed exporting in marked-up XLSX. Finally, I created an option to download pages from the application as PDFs.

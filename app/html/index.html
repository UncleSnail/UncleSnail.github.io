          Created as my first large programming project.
          <br>
          I had an idea for a game where the player controls
          their character indirectly by controlling another object.
          <br>
          This is the result.

          After discovering the ability to save shapes into an image in ProcessingJS,
          <br>
          I decided to push my abilities by procedurally generating planets with thousands of shapes,
          <br>
          then saving them as images so that they can still be displayed quickly.

          <br>
          My brother and I challeged each other to create the best game we could in 15 hours.
          <br>
          After some polishing directly after the competition, this is the result.
          <br>
          I also made a level editor so that I (and others) could easily create more levels.

          <br>
          From concept to completion, I worked independently and in cooperation with the small team at Myelin to
          create several new features. This included refactoring the existing architecture to accomidate the new
          features, integrating with other health care data platforms, and full system testing of new and existing
          features. One project involved precomputing urgency matching scores between patients and physicians
          allowing for minimal calculation to find an optimal fit at run time. Another involved setting up an
          asynchronous threaded task runner to retrieve and parse documents more quickly in the background.
          In both of these projects, my solutions increased time performance by several orders of magnitude.

          At Nobl I was allowed to complete diverse projects, including enhancing an existing graphing feature, 
          creating a new “patient management” page, and adding to the export options, allowing for styled spreadsheet and PDF downloads. 
          The experience was primarily with front-end engineering, but I also participated heavily in refactoring, 
          and pair programming. With the family of employees at Nobl, I had my first experience in professional 
          software development, including stand up meetings, backlogs, and version control. 
          I enjoyed my freedom to design and work with the team at Nobl.

          In my first year of Senior Design, I worked with four other students on WetSpace, 
          a project to connect the results from research in biological systems and nanotechnology. 
          This required working with software from two previous projects created by different teams, 
          as well as creating a new application and interface for WetSpace. I learned firsthand many 
          of the challenges that come with pulling and pushing data between and updating other 
          developer’s software. My primary contributions were the login page and ensuring client satisfaction.

          Similarly to the world of technology, this diverse set of tasks required me to be constantly learning and
